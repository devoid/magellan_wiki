Support
=======

Before you contact us, please do two things:

1. Take a look at the *known issues*.  If your issue is already listed,
please rest assured that we are working on resolving it.

2. Check if your *tenant sysadmin* would be better suited to help you.

> Note that our [[FAQ|FAQ]] and [[Documentation|docs]] may help you as well!

### Known Issues ###

* Check the [[status page|/status]] for any major issues.

* Frequent log outs when using the [[dashboard]]. If the browser is left
open on the dashboard, a logout will occur generating many "Session
Expired" warnings.

* Unable to use the [[Keystone CLI Client|python-keystoneclient]].

  Currently the Keystone command line client does not work when connecting
  from the external network. We are looking into this problem.

### Contact your [[tenant sysadmin|tenants]] ###

If your issue has to do with a specific image that is not working,
i.e. not the standard Ubuntu Precise 12.04 image, this is usually an issue
with the image, not Magellan. Therefore your [[tenant sysadmin|tenats]]
would be best suited to answer your question.

### Contact us ###

To help us in assisting you, please provide the following information:

* Which [[version of Magellan|openstack-versions]] are you using?
* If you have a question regarding an instance, what is the instance name?
* If you have a question regarding an image, what is the image name?
* If you have a question regarding a volume, what is the volume name?
* What is your user name?
* What [[tenant|tenants]] are you using?
