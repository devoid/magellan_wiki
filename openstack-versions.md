OpenStack Versions
==================

The [[OpenStack Project|http://openstack.org]] operates under a
twice-a-year release cycle with one release in April and another in
October. Releases have a codename and codenames proceed in alphabetical
order; if you are familiar with Ubuntu's naming scheme, this is exactly
the same. [[Openstack Releases|http://wiki.openstack.org/Releases]]

Current Magellan Openstack Versions
-----------------------------------

We currently maintain two separate versions of OpenStack, Diablo and
Essex. These are completely separate, meaning tenants, user accounts,
instances, volumes, etc. are not shared between the two versions.

Each version has a dashboard front-end:

* Diablo, [[https://nova.mcs.anl.gov]]
* Essex, [[https://cloud.mcs.anl.gov]]

> **Note that we will be disabling Diablo in February 2013.** Please
> use Essex for all future development as we intend to support that
> through Summer 2013.
