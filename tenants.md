# Magellan Tenants

In OpenStack, a *tenant* is the basic group under which all basic
resources (instances, volumes, IP addresses, etc.) are collectively owned.
Tenants have usage quotas, owners and members. A user may be a member
of multiple tenants.

This is a list of Magellan Tenants with a contact email for that tenant's
sysadmin.
